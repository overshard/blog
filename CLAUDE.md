# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

A personal blog (blog.bythewood.me) built as a Rust axum app that renders markdown files. No database — blog posts are `.md` files in `content/posts/` with YAML frontmatter. Uses headless Chromium for PDF export and comrak for markdown rendering.

This is a Rust port of the original Flask version (now deleted). Performance: ~30-50x lower memory, ~10-20x higher RPS, sub-millisecond per-request latency in release mode.

## Commands

- **Dev server:** `make run` (runs Vite watch + cargo run concurrently on port 8000)
- **Production build:** `make build` (Vite assets + release binary)
- **Run release binary:** `make start`
- **Bench sweep:** `make bench` (oha load test, used to compare against the old Flask version when both run side-by-side)
- **Docker build:** `sudo docker build .`

There are no tests or linters configured.

## Architecture

**Backend:** Single-binary axum app (`src/main.rs`). Posts are loaded from `content/posts/*.md` once at startup. Each post has frontmatter fields: title, slug, date, publish_date, tags, description, cover_image. Posts with `publish_date` in the future are hidden.

**Frontend pipeline:** Vite (run from `frontend/`) builds `frontend/static_src/` → `dist/`. Entry point is `frontend/static_src/index.js` which imports SCSS and JS. Output filenames are content-hashed (`base-[hash].js`, `base-[hash].css`) and a Vite manifest (`dist/.vite/manifest.json`) is read at runtime so templates can resolve the hashed names. Uses Bootstrap 5, CodeMirror, and Monaspace Argon font.

**Templates:** Jinja2 templates in `templates/` rendered by minijinja (Jinja2-faithful Rust engine by Armin Ronacher). `base.html` is the layout. Markdown post content is rendered through comrak with a custom renderer (`src/markdown.rs`) that wraps blocks in `div.block-*` classes — mirrors the original Mistune renderer pattern.

**PDF generation:** `src/pdf.rs` spawns chrome-headless-shell with `--print-to-pdf` against a temp `.html` file (the `.html` suffix matters — without it Chromium renders the HTML as plain text). Chromium binary is located via env var `CHROMIUM_BIN`, then PATH search, then a `/opt/playwright-browsers/` glob fallback.

**Manifest reload:** `templates.rs::build_env` re-reads `dist/.vite/manifest.json` per `vite_asset()` call in debug builds (so Vite watcher rebuilds are picked up immediately). Release builds load it once at startup. Gated on `cfg(debug_assertions)`.

**Request logging:** custom middleware in `src/main.rs::log_requests` prints `time METHOD STATUS latency path` per request, with ANSI-colored status codes (green 2xx, cyan 3xx, yellow 4xx, red 5xx). Always-on, costs sub-microsecond per request. The `.layer()` is applied after all routes so it covers `nest_service` static-file mounts and the `fallback` 404 handler.

**Content:** `content/posts/` for markdown posts, `content/images/` for images served at `/content/images/`.

```

The binary reads `templates/`, `dist/`, and `content/` from the current working directory by default. Override the project root with `BLOG_ROOT=<path>`.

## Tooling

- **Rust deps:** managed with `cargo` (see `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`)
- **JS deps:** managed with `bun`, run from `frontend/` (see `frontend/package.json`, `frontend/bun.lock`)
- **Production:** Docker (Alpine-based multi-stage, `rust:alpine` builder + `alpine:3.23` runtime), deployed via `docker-compose`. Runtime image installs `chromium` for PDF generation.

## Key Routes

- `/posts/<slug>/` — single post (old `/blog/<slug>/` 301-redirects here)
- `/posts/<slug>/pdf/` — PDF export via chrome-headless-shell
- `/posts/<slug>/md/` — raw markdown download
- `/blog/` — post index (also `/blog/tag/<tag>/` and `/blog/year/<year>/`)
- `/search/?q=...` — server-rendered search page
- `/search/live/?q=...` — JSON endpoint for live search
- `/og/<slug>.svg` — dynamic OG image generation
